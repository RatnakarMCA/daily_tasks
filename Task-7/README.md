TASK:7

Create a Bash shell script that automates basic system monitoring and cloud-style operations, similar to what a DevOps or Cloud Engineer would do on a Linux server.

Requirements

1️⃣ System Information

The script should display:

Hostname

Current date and time

Uptime

Logged-in users

2️⃣ Resource Monitoring

Check and display:

CPU usage

Memory usage

Disk usage (alert if any partition exceeds 80%)

3️⃣ Process Management

List the top 5 processes consuming the most CPU

If a process is consuming more than 70% CPU, log it to a file called high_cpu_process.log

4️⃣ Log Management

Create a directory called logs/ if it doesn’t exist

Save all script output into logs/system_report_<date>.log

Rotate logs older than 7 days
