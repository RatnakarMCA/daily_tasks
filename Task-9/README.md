Task:9

Terraform State Migration to Scale Instance Using count Without Destroying Existing Instance

Task Description:

Currently, an infrastructure instance is provisioned using Terraform as a single resource (without count). The requirement is to scale this resource to 5 instances using the count meta-argument, while ensuring that the existing instance remains intact and is not destroyed or recreated.

To achieve this, Terraform state file migration is required so the existing instance is mapped to count.index = 0.

Objective:

Modify the Terraform configuration to use count = 5

Preserve the existing instance as the first instance ([0])

Prevent Terraform from destroying and recreating the existing resource

Perform state file migration using Terraform state commands
